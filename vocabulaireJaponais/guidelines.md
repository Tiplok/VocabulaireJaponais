### Guidelines

* Please make sure to add kana versions of the Japanese words you add to the list in the Kana column.
* If a word is already 100% kana, you should leave the Kana cell empty.
* If a word is a common suru-verb, please add （する） to the Japanese column.
* If the French translation is not enough to convey the full meaning, use the Notes column to elaborate.
* Don't try to align the columns in the markdown files, it's impossible.
